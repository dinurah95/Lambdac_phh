# CP Asymmetry Analysis for Λ<sub>c</sub><sup>+</sup> → p<sup>+</sup> + h<sup>+</sup> + h<sup>−</sup> Decay Modes

This repository contains the codes and tools used for measuring Charge-Parity (CP) asymmetry in the decay modes of Λ<sub>c</sub><sup>+</sup> baryons using a Belle II Monte Carlo (MC) sample. 
This analysis is based on the Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB accelerator, using the basf2 framework.

The basf2 framework is primarily developed using C++, though Python is mainly used for executing tasks.
These codes also integrate several external libraries, most notably ROOT, zFit, and TensorFlow, which are used for physics analysis and machine learning tasks. 
EvtGen is used for Monte Carlo event generation, while Geant4 is used for particle simulation.
